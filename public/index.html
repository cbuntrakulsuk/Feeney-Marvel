                <p>Hello! I'm Mr. Feeney, and I'll be your 3rd-grade teacher for this school year! I teach in Room 16 at Linwood E. Howe Elementary. Welcome to my classroom website. Feel free to explore and look around our "classroom" to get to know our class space a little better.</p>
                <p>This is my sixth year teaching at LinHowe, and I love being a Viking! Usually, I am one of the first teachers on campus since I live in Burbank, and thus to avoid traffic I get to school extremely early. I believe in Social Learning - talk to the students as the people they are, listen to them, treat them with kindness, dignity, and respect. If you give them a reason to like you and appreciate you because you make them feel validated, cared for, and safe, they can't help but become invested in your class. Every student is capable of success. I love the discussions and problem-solving that occurs in my classroom daily. I believe in helping students find their voice, expressing and articulating their thoughts to others clearly, and empowering them to have the lifelong skills to help them succeed in all their future endeavors.</p>
                <p>I would consider my self an adventure junkie. In my free time, I love to read, travel, watch movies(huge Back To The Future fan), and try new experiences. I've gone skydiving, climbed a 17,000-foot mountain in the Andes, and even swam with sharks in Hawaii! I love meeting new people, immersing myself in different cultures, and expanding my horizons. For the past six years, I have traveled to a different country during every school break, a luxury that not everyone can afford, and thus something I am extremely grateful for being able to do. One of my favorite quotes by Mark Twain truly captures what I think about travel and why it's so vital to me as an educator, "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.”</p>
